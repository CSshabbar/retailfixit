Create a cloud architecture diagram for a mobile-first retail repair management platform called "RetailFixIt". Use clean, professional styling with clear labels and directional arrows showing data flow.

=== COMPONENTS ===

GROUP: Mobile Client (React Native Expo)
- Login Screen
- Job List Screen (with status filters)
- Job Detail Screen (with photo gallery)
- Create Job Screen
- Activity Screen (sync status)
- Profile Screen

GROUP: Mobile Local Storage
- SQLite Database (jobs, pending_actions, sync_meta tables)
- SecureStore (encrypted JWT tokens)

GROUP: Mobile Services Layer
- Sync Engine (delta sync + action queue drain)
- SignalR Client (WebSocket, auto-reconnect)
- API Client (HTTP, bearer auth, 10s timeout)
- Image Picker (camera + photo library)

GROUP: Express 5 Backend (Node.js 18+, TypeScript)
- Helmet (security headers)
- CORS Middleware
- Gzip Compression
- Pino Logger (structured JSON logging)
- JWT Auth Middleware
- RBAC Middleware (admin, dispatcher, technician)
- REST API Routes:
  - GET /api/health (health check)
  - POST /api/auth/login (authentication)
  - GET /api/auth/technicians (list technicians)
  - GET /api/jobs (list jobs, paginated, filtered by role)
  - GET /api/jobs/:id (job detail with SAS URLs)
  - POST /api/jobs (create job)
  - PATCH /api/jobs/:id/status (update status with eTag)
  - POST /api/jobs/:id/assign (assign technician)
  - DELETE /api/jobs/:id (admin only)
  - POST /api/jobs/sync (delta sync endpoint)
  - POST /api/jobs/:id/attachments (photo upload, multipart)
  - DELETE /api/jobs/:id/attachments/:attachmentId (delete photo)
  - POST /api/signalr/negotiate (get SignalR token)

GROUP: Azure Cloud Services
- Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL, Serverless)
  - Database: RetailFixItDB
  - Container: Jobs (partition key: /tenantId)
  - Container: Users (partition key: /tenantId)
  - Features: eTag optimistic concurrency, cross-partition queries, patch operations
- Azure SignalR Service (Serverless mode)
  - Hub: retailfixit
  - Groups: vendor-{vendorId}, user-{userId}, admin
  - Events: JobCreated, JobAssigned, JobStatusChanged, JobDeleted
  - REST API v2022-11-01 for broadcasting
- Azure Blob Storage
  - Account: attachmentsjob
  - Container: job-attachments
  - Blob path: {tenantId}/{jobId}/{attachmentId}.{ext}
  - SAS URLs: 1-hour read-only expiry

GROUP: RBAC Model (3 Roles)
- Admin: sees all vendors, all jobs, full CRUD, delete access
- Dispatcher: sees own vendor's jobs, create/assign/cancel, manage technicians
- Technician: sees only assigned jobs, update status (cannot cancel), upload photos

=== CONNECTIONS / DATA FLOWS ===

1. Mobile App --> Express Backend: HTTPS REST API calls (JSON, bearer token auth, gzip compressed)
2. Mobile App <-- Azure SignalR Service: WSS WebSocket (real-time push events, direct connection)
3. Express Backend --> Azure Cosmos DB: Read/write job and user documents (SDK)
4. Express Backend --> Azure Blob Storage: Upload/delete photo blobs (SDK)
5. Express Backend --> Azure SignalR Service: REST API broadcast to groups/users
6. Mobile App --> Azure Blob Storage: Direct photo download via SAS URLs (bypasses backend)
7. Mobile App <--> SQLite Database: Local read/write for offline-first caching
8. Mobile App --> SecureStore: Encrypted JWT token storage on device
9. Express Backend --> Pino Logger: Structured JSON request/response logging
10. SignalR Service --> Mobile App: Push events (JobCreated, JobAssigned, JobStatusChanged, JobDeleted)

=== KEY DATA FLOWS TO HIGHLIGHT ===

FLOW 1 - Offline Sync:
Mobile writes to SQLite pending_actions queue → When online, Sync Engine drains queue via REST API → Then pulls delta changes via POST /api/jobs/sync {since: timestamp} → Upserts to local SQLite (skipping pending jobs)

FLOW 2 - Real-Time Updates:
Backend updates Cosmos DB → Backend broadcasts via SignalR REST API → SignalR pushes to mobile via WebSocket → Mobile upserts event data to SQLite → UI refreshes automatically

FLOW 3 - Photo Upload:
User picks photo (camera/gallery) → Mobile sends multipart POST to backend → Backend stores blob in Azure Blob Storage → Backend patches Cosmos DB job document → Returns attachment metadata + SAS URL → Mobile displays photo

FLOW 4 - Conflict Resolution:
Mobile sends PATCH with stale eTag → Backend returns 409 Conflict → Sync Engine marks job as 'conflict' → UI shows red conflict banner → User chooses: accept server version OR retry with fresh eTag

FLOW 5 - Authentication:
User enters email/password → POST /api/auth/login → Backend validates via Cosmos DB + bcrypt → Returns JWT token → Mobile stores in SecureStore → All subsequent requests include Bearer token → Backend JWT middleware validates on every request

=== STYLING NOTES ===
- Use Azure-branded colors for cloud services (blue for Cosmos DB, purple for SignalR, orange for Blob Storage)
- Mobile client section should be in green/teal
- Backend section should be in gray/dark
- Show the offline-first nature prominently (SQLite sitting between the UI and the network)
- Arrows should show direction of data flow
- Group related components together with clear boundaries
